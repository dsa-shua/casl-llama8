This docker file contains all the necessary files to run LLAMA3 8B model 
in a docker container using the Lab's 4090 GPU.

To run the experiment to replicate figure 4C of the paper, run:

run.sh

in the /root/casl/llama directory. This will automatically run
all commands to set up the experiment including generation of 
the output figure and csv data file.

All the CSV and images generated will be located in 
/root/casl/llama/results/{img/ or data/} directories.

You can use VSCODE then attach to the container to download the 
image file. 

scp command may not run as this dockerfile is not built with exposed ports
for external communication. You can add that feature to the build.sh file
but it is not tested and is not guaranteed that the container will run 
properly. 


'include' directory includes the base and modified source codes for LLAMA model. 

1. base.py	- absolute base source code with no modifications. 
2. attn_mlp.py	- this includes torch.profiler for attention and mlp layers. (Replicate Figure 4C)
3. block.py	- includes torch.profiler for the whole block. (Replicate Figure 2) [Not impelemented!]

'util' directory includes the proces.py file for processing the generated 
txt files for the generation of graphs and csv files. These files can be
located in /root/casl/results/{img/ or data/} directories.
